# Match In A Snap

## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for both the frontend and backend of Match In A Snap service, by Snapee Pte
Ltd.

This service was built to recommend various restaurants to users that are tired of not knowing what to eat every day.

The website recommends the nearest restaurants base on the **(Singapore)** postal code and dietary preferences entered
by users. [Check it out here!](https://tryingoutsomething.github.io/match-in-a-snap/)

### Disclaimer

displayed in the demo are static restaurant information from eateries/restaurants in Singapore.

#### Tools used to create this service:

Backend: NodeJS
